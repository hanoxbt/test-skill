    And on-chain: the seller's balance increases by exactly 10000 USDC
    And no intermediary fee affects the amounts
    # REVIEW: value not in spec — whether trading fee applies to OTC is unclear

  @token @critical
  Scenario: SC-58 — Token approval before OTC deposit
    # Covers: REQ-18
    Given the seller wants to deposit 5000 ABC tokens into escrow
    When the seller has not yet approved the token for the smart contract
    Then a prompt is displayed requesting approval
    And after approval → the deposit transaction is submitted
    And the approval amount = exact 5000 (not infinite approval)

  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-59 — Swap event emitted when OTC trade succeeds
    # Covers: REQ-20, REQ-27
    Given the buyer has successfully accepted an OTC offer
    When querying the transaction receipt
    Then the OfferSettled event is emitted with: offerId, seller, buyer, token, amount, price
    And the event can be indexed and queried

  @web3 @major
  Scenario: SC-60 — Cross-chain OTC: Solana token sold → EVM payment
    # Covers: REQ-28
    Given the seller creates an offer to sell a token on Solana

### ✅ Happy Path & Basic

```gherkin
Feature: Smart Contract / Escrow

  Background:
    Given the WhalesEscrow smart contract is deployed on blockchain
    And the contract is operating normally

  @happy-path @basic @critical
  Scenario: SC-61 — createOffer deposits collateral and returns offerId
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller has approved the collateral token for the contract
    When the seller calls createOffer(token, 1000, "0.5 USDC", collateral)
    Then the transaction succeeds
    And a new offerId is returned
    And the contract balance increases by exactly the collateral amount
    And the OfferCreated event is emitted with the correct parameters

  @happy-path @basic @critical
  Scenario: SC-62 — acceptOffer locks buyer payment successfully
    # Covers: REQ-22
    Given an offer is at status Open
    When the buyer calls acceptOffer(offerId) with sufficient payment
    Then the payment is locked in the contract
    And offer.buyer = buyer address
    And offer.status = Accepted
    And the OfferAccepted event is emitted

  @happy-path @basic @major
  Scenario: SC-63 — closeOffer refunds collateral minus 0.5% fee
    # Covers: REQ-23
    Given the seller has an Open offer (no buyer has accepted)
    And collateral = 100 USDC
    When the seller calls closeOffer(offerId)
    Then the seller receives 99.5 USDC (100 - 0.5%)
    And 0.5 USDC is transferred to the platform fee address
    And offer.status = Closed
    And the OfferClosed event is emitted

  @happy-path @basic @critical
  Scenario: SC-64 — settleOffer: seller deposits tokens → swap succeeds
    # Covers: REQ-24
    Given the offer has been accepted, TGE has occurred, and the countdown is running
    When the seller calls settleOffer(offerId) and deposits the correct number of tokens
    Then tokens are transferred to the buyer
    And payment is transferred to the seller
    And offer.status = Settled
    And the OfferSettled event is emitted

  @happy-path @basic @critical
  Scenario: SC-65 — cancelOffer: buyer receives refund + collateral compensation
    # Covers: REQ-25
    Given an offer was accepted but the seller has defaulted (4h expired without settlement)
    When the buyer calls cancelOffer(offerId)
    Then the buyer receives the payment refund + collateral compensation
    And offer.status = Cancelled
    And the OfferCancelled event is emitted

  @happy-path @basic @critical
  Scenario: SC-66 — claimCollateral: buyer claims when seller misses deadline
    # Covers: REQ-26
    Given the offer was accepted, the 4h deadline has passed, and the seller has not settled
    When the buyer calls claimCollateral(offerId)
    Then the buyer receives the collateral
    And offer.status = Defaulted
    And the buyer's payment is refunded
```

### ⚠️ Edge Cases & Negative

```gherkin
  @negative @major
  Scenario: SC-67 — createOffer with amount exceeding seller balance → revert
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller has a balance of 50 USDC for collateral
    When the seller calls createOffer with collateral = 100 USDC
    Then the transaction reverts: "insufficient balance"
    And the contract state does not change

  @negative @major
  Scenario: SC-68 — acceptOffer on an already Closed offer → revert
    # Covers: REQ-22
    Given the offer has been Closed by the seller
    When the buyer calls acceptOffer(offerId)
    Then the transaction reverts: "offer not open"
    And the buyer's payment is not locked

  @negative @critical
  Scenario: SC-69 — closeOffer on an offer with an active buyer (already accepted) → revert
    # Covers: REQ-23
    Given the offer has been Accepted (a buyer has locked payment)
    When the seller calls closeOffer(offerId)
    Then the transaction reverts: "offer already accepted"
    And both collateral and payment remain locked in the contract

  @negative @major
  Scenario: SC-70 — settleOffer with incorrect token amount → revert
    # Covers: REQ-24
    Given the offer requires 1000 tokens
    When the seller calls settleOffer and only deposits 500 tokens
    Then the transaction reverts: "incorrect token amount"
    And the offer state does not change — the seller needs to deposit the correct amount

  @negative @critical
  Scenario: SC-71 — cancelOffer by a user who is not the buyer → revert
    # Covers: REQ-25
    Given the offer has been accepted by buyer A
    When user C (not buyer A) calls cancelOffer(offerId)
    Then the transaction reverts: "unauthorized"
    And no funds are moved

  @negative @major
  Scenario: SC-72 — claimCollateral before the deadline expires → revert
    # Covers: REQ-26
    Given the offer is accepted and the 4h countdown is running (2h remaining)
    When the buyer calls claimCollateral(offerId)
    Then the transaction reverts: "deadline not expired"
    And the collateral remains locked in the contract

  @edge-case @critical
  Scenario: SC-73 — closeOffer called twice on the same offerId → second call reverts
    # Covers: REQ-23
    Given the seller has successfully closed the offer once
    When the seller calls closeOffer(offerId) a second time
    Then the transaction reverts: "offer not open"
    And the seller does not receive any additional funds
```

### 🔒 Security / DeFi Security

```gherkin
  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-74 — Reentrancy attack on settleOffer
    # Covers: REQ-24
    Given an attacker deploys a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls settleOffer again
    When the malicious contract triggers settleOffer
    Then the contract uses the checks-effects-interactions pattern
    And the reentrancy guard (mutex) blocks the recursive call
    And only 1 settlement succeeds — funds are safe

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-75 — Reentrancy attack on cancelOffer
    # Covers: REQ-25
    Given an attacker deploys a contract with a fallback that calls cancelOffer again
    When the malicious contract triggers cancelOffer
    Then the reentrancy guard blocks the second call
    And the buyer only receives compensation once

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-76 — Repeated cancelOffer drain — multiple calls before state update
    # Covers: REQ-25
    Given the offer has defaulted (seller missed the deadline)
    When the attacker sends multiple cancelOffer transactions in rapid succession within the same block
    Then only the first transaction succeeds
    And subsequent transactions revert: "offer already cancelled"
    And the contract balance is not drained

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-77 — Repeated claimCollateral — buyer attempts to claim multiple times
    # Covers: REQ-26
    Given the buyer has successfully claimed collateral once
    When the buyer calls claimCollateral(offerId) a second time
    Then the transaction reverts: "already claimed"
    And the collateral is not transferred a second time
    And the contract state marks the offer as claimed

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-78 — Cancel + Settle race condition — both succeed simultaneously
    # Covers: REQ-24, REQ-25
    Given the offer has been accepted and the deadline is about to expire
    When the seller submits settleOffer AND the buyer submits cancelOffer at the same time
    Then the smart contract uses a mutex lock on the offer state
    And only 1 of the 2 transactions succeeds (depending on confirmation order)
    And the other transaction reverts: "invalid offer status"
    And funds are not duplicated

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-79 — Flash loan attack to inflate collateral value
    # Covers: REQ-7
    Given an attacker flash loans a large amount of tokens
    When the attacker creates an offer with the flash-loaned tokens as collateral
    And attempts to withdraw the collateral within the same transaction
    Then the smart contract requires collateral to remain locked until the offer is closed/settled
    And the flash loan repay fails because collateral is locked → entire transaction reverts

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-80 — Front-running / MEV on acceptOffer
    # Covers: REQ-4
    Given an attractive offer has just been created on Pre-Market
    When an MEV bot detects an acceptOffer transaction in the mempool
    And the bot submits a transaction with higher gas to front-run
    Then the system needs a deadline/commit-reveal scheme or private mempool
    # HIGH RISK: Spec does not mention any MEV protection mechanism

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-81 — Integer overflow on collateral/amount calculation
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller creates an offer with an amount close to uint256 max
    When the smart contract calculates collateral × price
    Then no overflow occurs (Solidity 0.8+ auto-reverts or SafeMath is used)
    And the transaction reverts if the result exceeds uint256

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-82 — Access control bypass — non-admin triggers settlement
    # Covers: REQ-11
    Given a regular user (not an admin)
    When the user calls the function to trigger settlement countdown
    Then the transaction reverts: "admin only"
    And the settlement countdown does not start

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-83 — Signature replay across chains: Solana ↔ EVM
    # Covers: REQ-28
    Given a user performs settleOffer on Solana chain
    When an attacker copies the transaction signature and replays it on an EVM chain
    Then the EVM contract rejects it — the signature contains a chain-specific nonce/chainId
    And the offer on EVM is not affected

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-84 — Rugpull indicators — admin functions have excessive control
    # Covers: REQ-11
    Given the WhalesEscrow contract has admin functions
    When an audit reviews admin capabilities
    Then it flags if the admin can: pause + withdraw all funds, change fee > [TBD]%, mint tokens
    And recommends: timelock on admin functions, multi-sig requirement
    # HIGH RISK: Spec does not specify admin power limits — requires audit

  @defi-security @critical
  Scenario: SC-85 — Private key exposure — key is not leaked in logs/storage
    # Covers: REQ-3
    Given the user has connected a wallet and performed transactions
    When checking browser console, localStorage, and network requests
    Then no private key appears anywhere
    And only the public address is stored/displayed
```

### 🔗 Smart Contract

```gherkin
  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-86 — Gas estimation for createOffer displayed before confirmation
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller is creating an offer
    When the wallet popup is displayed for transaction confirmation
    Then the gas estimate is clearly shown
    And a warning is displayed if gas is unusually high (> [TBD] gwei)
    # REVIEW: value not in spec — gas threshold is not defined

  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-87 — Failed transaction displays clear revert reason
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller creates an offer but the transaction fails
    When the transaction reverts
    Then the UI displays the revert reason from the smart contract (e.g., "insufficient collateral")
    And does not only show a generic "Transaction failed"

  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-88 — OfferCreated event is emitted with correct parameters
    # Covers: REQ-27
    Given the seller creates an offer successfully
    When querying event logs from the transaction receipt
    Then the OfferCreated event contains: offerId, seller address, token, amount, price, collateral
    And the event can be filtered by indexed parameters

  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-89 — All 5 events emit correctly for each lifecycle action
    # Covers: REQ-27
    Given an offer goes through the full lifecycle: Created → Accepted → Settled
    When querying event logs for the offerId
    Then events are in order: OfferCreated → OfferAccepted → OfferSettled
    And each event contains sufficient data to reconstruct the offer state

  @smart-contract @major
  Scenario: SC-90 — Nonce management — creating multiple offers in rapid succession
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the seller creates 5 offers in rapid succession
    When all transactions are submitted
    Then each transaction has a sequential nonce (n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4)
    And all offers are created successfully
    And there are no nonce conflicts
```

### 🪙 Token

```gherkin
  @token @critical
  Scenario: SC-91 — Token decimal handling in collateral calculation
    # Covers: REQ-21
    Given the collateral token = USDC (6 decimals)
    And the collateral amount = 100 USDC
    When the smart contract stores the collateral
    Then the on-chain value = 100000000 (100 × 10^6)
    And the UI displays "100.000000 USDC"
    And the 0.5% fee calculation = 0.5 USDC = 500000 (on-chain)

  @token @major
  Scenario: SC-92 — Collateral amount displayed with correct precision
    # Covers: REQ-7
    Given an offer has collateral = 99.123456 USDC (6 decimals)
    When displayed on the UI
    Then it shows "99.123456 USDC" — no incorrect rounding
    And a tooltip or detail view shows full precision

  @token @critical
  Scenario: SC-93 — Fee calculation 0.5% with correct rounding
    # Covers: REQ-23
    Given collateral = 100.000001 USDC
    When closeOffer calculates the 0.5% fee
    Then fee = 0.500000 USDC (rounded in the protocol's favor)
    And the seller receives 99.500001 USDC
    And total fee + refund = original collateral (no dust lost)
```

### ⛓️ Blockchain

```gherkin
  @blockchain @major
  Scenario: SC-94 — Transaction confirmation required before updating UI state
    # Covers: REQ-28
    Given the seller has just submitted a createOffer transaction
    When the transaction is pending (not yet confirmed)
    Then the UI displays status "Pending" with a loading indicator
    And the offer does not appear on the marketplace yet
    And after confirmation → the status updates and the offer is displayed

  @blockchain @major
  Scenario: SC-95 — Chain reorg handling — confirmed settlement is reversed
    # Covers: REQ-28
    Given settleOffer was confirmed at block N
    When a chain reorg occurs and block N is replaced
    Then the system detects the reorg
    And the offer status rolls back to the state before settlement
    And the UI notifies the user to check the transaction again

  @blockchain @major
  Scenario: SC-96 — Transaction stuck in mempool — speed-up or cancel option
    # Covers: REQ-28
    Given the user submitted a transaction but the gas price was too low
    When the transaction has been pending for more than [TBD] minutes
    Then the UI displays options: "Speed Up" (increase gas) or "Cancel" (send 0-value tx with same nonce)
    And the user can choose the appropriate action
    # REVIEW: value not in spec — mempool timeout threshold is not defined
```

## 🛡️ Security Review Report

> Auto-generated based on spec analysis. Not a penetration test — a structured review of security risks identified from the spec.

### Attack Surface Summary

| Surface | Risk Level | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Contract (Escrow)** | 🔴 High | 6 state-changing functions handling user funds — reentrancy, access control, state manipulation risks |
| **Wallet Connection** | 🟡 Medium | Multi-chain wallet integration (Solana + EVM) — session hijack, phishing risks |
| **API Gateway** | 🟡 Medium | Backend services: order matching, price oracle, notifications — injection, rate limiting |
| **Admin Functions** | 🔴 High | Admin triggers settlement — single point of failure, privilege escalation |
| **Token Verification** | 🟡 Medium | Mint address verification for unlisted tokens — fake token, phishing risks |
| **User Input Forms** | 🟡 Medium | Create Offer form (price, amount, token) — injection, overflow |
| **Cross-chain Bridge** | 🔴 High | Solana ↔ EVM communication — replay attacks, attestation manipulation |
| **File Uploads** | ⚪ N/A | No file upload in spec |

### Identified Vulnerabilities

| # | Vulnerability | Severity | OWASP | Affected Feature | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | Reentrancy on settleOffer/cancelOffer/claimCollateral | 🔴 Critical | A01:2021 Broken Access Control | Smart Contract | Implement ReentrancyGuard (OpenZeppelin) on all state-changing functions. Use checks-effects-interactions pattern |
| V-2 | Repeated cancel/claim drain — multiple calls before state update | 🔴 Critical | A01:2021 Broken Access Control | Smart Contract | Use mutex lock + update state BEFORE external call. Add boolean flag "claimed"/"cancelled" check at function entry |
| V-3 | Cancel + Settle race condition | 🔴 Critical | A04:2021 Insecure Design | Smart Contract | Implement mutex lock on offer state. Both settle and cancel must check-and-set offer.status atomically |
| V-4 | Admin privilege escalation — single admin triggers settlement | 🔴 Critical | A01:2021 Broken Access Control | Settlement | Add multi-sig requirement for admin actions. Implement timelock (24h delay) for critical admin functions |
| V-5 | Front-running / MEV on acceptOffer | 🟡 Medium | A04:2021 Insecure Design | Pre-Market | Implement commit-reveal scheme or integrate private mempool (Flashbots/Jito) |
| V-6 | Cross-chain signature replay (Solana ↔ EVM) | 🔴 Critical | A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures | Multi-chain | Include chainId in signed data (EIP-712 for EVM). Verify chain-specific nonce on each chain |
| V-7 | Integer overflow on amount × price calculation | 🟡 Medium | A03:2021 Injection | Smart Contract | Use Solidity ≥0.8.0 (built-in overflow protection) or SafeMath. Validate input ranges |
| V-8 | XSS in token name/symbol display | 🟡 Medium | A03:2021 Injection | OTC Market | Escape HTML entities before rendering token metadata. Use content security policy |
| V-9 | IDOR — accessing trade details via sequential ID | 🟡 Medium | A01:2021 Broken Access Control | API | Use UUID instead of sequential ID. Verify ownership before returning sensitive data |
| V-10 | Flash loan collateral manipulation | 🔴 Critical | A04:2021 Insecure Design | Pre-Market | Lock collateral permanently (no withdrawal in same block). Verify collateral source |

### DeFi-Specific Security Findings

| # | Vulnerability | Severity | Attack Vector | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DV-1 | Reentrancy on 3 fund-moving functions | 🔴 Critical | External call before state update | ReentrancyGuard + checks-effects-interactions on settleOffer, cancelOffer, claimCollateral |
| DV-2 | Repeated cancel drain | 🔴 Critical | Calling cancelOffer multiple times in same block | Boolean flag `offer.cancelled = true` check at function entry, set before external call |
| DV-3 | Cancel + Settle race | 🔴 Critical | Submit both simultaneously | Mutex lock on offer status — state transition only valid: Open→Accepted→Settled/Cancelled/Defaulted |
| DV-4 | Flash loan collateral | 🔴 Critical | Borrow → deposit → withdraw in 1 tx | Prevent collateral withdrawal in the same block as deposit |
| DV-5 | MEV front-running on acceptOffer | 🟡 Medium | Mempool observation | Commit-reveal or private mempool integration |
| DV-6 | Admin rugpull potential | 🔴 Critical | Admin can pause + drain | Multi-sig + timelock + cap fee changes + no admin withdrawal |
| DV-7 | Cross-chain replay | 🔴 Critical | Replay tx on another chain | Chain-specific nonce + EIP-712 domain separator |
| DV-8 | Oracle manipulation (if collateral valuation uses oracle) | 🟡 Medium | Stale/manipulated price feed | Multi-source oracle + staleness check + TWAP |

### Recommendations for Dev Team

**🔴 Fix before launch:**
1. **[V-1, DV-1]** Add `ReentrancyGuard` (OpenZeppelin) to all 6 functions in WhalesEscrow. Apply checks-effects-interactions pattern: update state → emit event → transfer funds
2. **[V-2, DV-2]** Add boolean `claimed`/`cancelled` flag. Check flag at function entry, set flag BEFORE external call. Example: `require(!offer.claimed); offer.claimed = true; transfer()`
3. **[V-3, DV-3]** Implement strict state machine: `Open → Accepted → {Settled | Cancelled | Defaulted}`. Each transition checks current state before changing. Use enum for status
4. **[V-4, DV-6]** Admin functions must go through multi-sig (3/5 minimum). Add 48h timelock for: fee changes, contract pause, fund withdrawal. Log all admin actions on-chain
5. **[V-6, DV-7]** Include `chainId` in signed data. EVM: use EIP-712 domain separator. Solana: include cluster identifier in instruction data
6. **[V-10, DV-4]** Prevent collateral withdrawal in the same block as deposit. Add minimum lock duration (at least 1 block)

**🟡 Fix in next sprint:**
7. **[V-5, DV-5]** Evaluate commit-reveal scheme for acceptOffer or integrate Jito (Solana) / Flashbots (EVM) for private transaction submission
8. **[V-7]** Validate all input ranges: amount > 0, price > 0, collateral > minimum. Use SafeMath for all arithmetic operations
9. **[V-8]** Implement strict HTML escaping for all on-chain metadata display. Add Content-Security-Policy header
10. **[V-9]** Migrate from sequential IDs to UUID for offers. Add ownership check on the API layer

**ℹ️ Security assumptions (not tested by this suite):**
- Smart contract audit has been completed (spec section 5.1 states "Full audit completed") — this test suite does not replace formal verification
- HTTPS enforcement is handled at the load balancer / CDN layer
- Database encryption at rest is handled by the infra team
- DDoS protection is handled by CDN/WAF
- Solana program security (BPF-specific vulnerabilities) is out of scope — requires a separate audit

## 🚨 Risk Areas & Notes

- `AMBIGUOUS:` REQ-29 — $WHALES fee discount mechanism is unclear: what discount percentage, based on what criteria (hold amount, stake amount, tier), applied to Pre-Market or OTC or both? Cannot write test cases until the spec is supplemented
- `AMBIGUOUS:` Cross-chain OTC (SC-60) — Spec mentions multi-chain support but does not describe the cross-chain swap mechanism (Solana seller ↔ EVM buyer). Needs clarification: bridge integration or same-chain only?
- `AMBIGUOUS:` Settlement countdown trigger — Spec says "admin triggers settle" but does not clarify: single admin or multi-sig? Automated detection or manual? Rollback if TGE is delayed?
- `AMBIGUOUS:` Collateral ratio — Spec does not specify minimum collateral ratio. Can the seller set extremely low collateral? A clear business rule is needed
- `MISSING:` API endpoint paths — Spec does not define API contracts. Test cases SC-28, SC-29, SC-30, SC-54, SC-55, SC-56 use inferred paths — additional API spec needed
- `MISSING:` Error messages — Spec does not define exact error messages for validation failures. Scenarios marked `[TBD]` need to be updated when the UI spec is available
- `MISSING:` Rate limiting configuration — Spec does not specify rate limits for the API. Recommended: 100 req/min for read, 10 req/min for write operations
- `MISSING:` Gas limit configurations — Max gas per contract function is not specified
- `HIGH RISK:` Admin privilege — Admin can trigger settlement for any project. If the admin key is compromised → can trigger fake TGE settlement. Recommend multi-sig + timelock
- `HIGH RISK:` Repeated cancel/claim attack vector — This is the most common attack vector for escrow contracts. Requires reentrancy guard + state check at the beginning of each function
- `HIGH RISK:` Front-running risk — acceptOffer on the public mempool is easily front-run by MEV bots. Impact: good offers get sniped before retail users
- `TEST DATA:` Testnet deployment needed (Solana Devnet + Goerli/Sepolia) with fake tokens to test the full flow
- `TEST DATA:` Test wallets needed: at least 3 (seller, buyer, attacker) on each chain
- `TEST DATA:` Mock TGE event needed — contract that allows admin to trigger settlement on testnet
